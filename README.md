To try it you have just to input some data - integers or floats.
Then it will tell you if it's day or night.
Also it's able to tell you about your ideal weight. Cringe topic, I know :dizzy_face:

That's a text game. To play it you have to be really attentive to the format of the data

whom do you want to play against? :scroll::snake::new_moon::scissors::bust_in_silhouette:
